<p>I'm <strong>Billy Brown</strong>, a young developer from Belgium, currently in my third year of study of a 5-year masters <strong>Computer Science</strong> course at <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" title="St Andrews University">St&nbsp;Andrews University</a>, Scotland. My topics of study include systems programming, computational complexity, artificial intelligence, distributed systems and more, lending me both knowledge and experience in many fields of Computer Science.</p>

<p>I am currently a Databases and IT Intern at the University of St Andrews <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/development/" title="St Andrews University Development Office">Development Office</a>, where I build .NET web applications with Microsoft C#, ASP and SQLServer.</p>

<p>A notable personal <strong>project</strong> of mine is <a href="https://github.com/Druid-of-Luhn/cropper.js" title="cropper.js">cropper.js</a>, a small embeddable JavaScript application for interactively cropping images in the browser. It was originally developed for my internship but has now been published as an  <strong>open source</strong> project.</p>

<p>I try to maintain a strong internet presence on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>, where you can hear of and take a look at my various projects.</p>

    <p class="text__intro">I'm <strong>Billy Brown</strong>, a young developer from Belgium, currently in my fifth year of study of a 5-year masters <strong>Computer Science</strong> course at <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" title="St Andrews University">St&nbsp;Andrews University</a>, Scotland. My topics of study include systems programming, computational complexity, artificial intelligence, computer security and more, lending me both knowledge and experience in many fields of Computer Science.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Databases and IT Intern at the University of St Andrews <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/development/" title="St Andrews University Development Office">Development Office</a>, where I build .NET web applications with Microsoft C#, ASP and SQLServer.</p>

    <p>Last summer (June-August 2017) I worked on my project for the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/involve/laidlaw/">The Laidlaw Scholarship Programme in Research and Leadership</a>. Working in <strong>constraint programming</strong> with Essence, my task was to add a <strong>specification strengthening</strong> feature to <a href="https://github.com/Druid-of-Luhn/conjure">Conjure: The Automated Constraint Modelling Tool</a>, which infers tighter variable domains and new constraints without losing solutions. I applied the tool to the problems on <a href="http://csplib.org">csplib</a>, <strong>improving</strong> their solve time in some cases. This is also my first major contribution to <strong>open source software</strong>.</p>

    <p>I try to maintain a visible internet presence on <a href="https://twitter.com/_Billy_Brown" role="link">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Druid-of-Luhn" role="link">GitHub</a>, where you can hear of and take a look at my various projects.</p>

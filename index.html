<h1>About Me, Billy Brown</h1>

<p>I'm <strong>Billy Brown</strong>, a young web-designer and developer from Belgium, currently starting my third year of study of a 5-year masters <strong>Computer Science</strong> course at <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" title="St Andrews University">St&nbsp;Andrews University</a>, Scotland, where I study systems and network programming, web-development, artificial intelligence and more, lending me both knowledge and experience in many fields of Computer Science.</p>

<p>I have 5 years of experience in <strong>web-development</strong> and 4 years in <strong>desktop programming</strong>, and have recently started paid work for building and running websites, as well as general technology consultancy.</p>

<p>The actual design of a website is not my area of expertise; I prefer to implement designs both on the <strong>front-</strong> and <strong>back-end</strong>, using skills I have taught myself over the years, or learned more recently here at university.</p>

<p>I try to maintain a strong internet presence on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>, where you can hear of and inspect my different projects.</p>

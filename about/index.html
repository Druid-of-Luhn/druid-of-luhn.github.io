<h1>About</h1>

<p>I'm <strong>Billy Brown</strong>, a young web-designer and developer from Belgium, currently in my second year of study of a 5-year masters <strong>Computer Science</strong> course at <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" title="St Andrews University">St Andrews University</a>, Scotland.</p>

<p>I have 4 years of experience in <strong>web-design</strong> and <strong>-development</strong>, and have recently started paid work for building and running websites, as well as general technology consultancy.</p>

<p>The actual design of a website is not my area of expertise; I prefer to implement designs both on the <strong>front-</strong> and <strong>back-end</strong>, using skills I have taught myself over the years, or learned more recently here at university.</p>

<p>In my earlier internet history, I have been known as the <strong>Druid&nbsp;of&nbsp;LÃ»hn</strong> and can be found around the web on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DruidofL%C3%BBhn" title="Google Plus">various</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/_Billy_Brown" title="Twitter">social</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Druid-of-Luhn" title="GitHub">technical</a> <a href="http://css-tricks.com/forums/users/cyneWATCH/forums/all-topics/" title="CSS-Tricks forums">websites</a>.
